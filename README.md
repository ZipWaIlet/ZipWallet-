# 💨 ZipWallet

**ZipWallet** — fast, smart Solana wallet with AI-powered risk detection and market insights, giving you clarity and control on every move.

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✳ Token Logic Scanner  
Flags risky token permissions like open minting or unlocked liquidity. Helps you avoid tokens with malicious configurations.

### ✳ ZipRisk Scoring Engine  
Real-time token scoring system based on blacklist presence, wallet ownership distribution, and liquidity status.

### ✳ Whale Pattern Watch  
Analyzes wallet holder distribution to identify high concentration of large holders that may indicate potential price manipulation or rug scenarios.

### ✳ Risk Tag Translator  
Simplifies complex numeric risk scores into clear, human-readable labels: `Safe`, `Watch`, or `Risk`, making decisions faster and easier.

### ✳ Insight Sync Logger  
Continuously logs token risk data over time to improve AI accuracy and detect evolving threats based on real market behavior.

## 🧬 Open Source Functions

Below are core AI-driven logic blocks that power ZipWallet’s real-time token intelligence. These are simplified examples used in our internal simulation and evolving AI layer.

### ✳ Token Logic Scanner  
Detects dangerous token permissions and flags critical risks.

```python
def scan_token_logic(token):
    flags = []
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        flags.append("Uncapped Minting")
    if token.get("freeze_authority") == "active":
        flags.append("Transfer Freeze Enabled")
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", False):
        flags.append("Liquidity Unlocked")
    return flags
```
#### 🧠 AI Context: Matches token traits with known attack signatures to flag risks early.

### ✳ ZipRisk Scoring Engine
#### Scores token health in real time based on multiple risk vectors.

```python
def zip_risk_score(token):
    score = 100
    if token.get("blacklist", False): score -= 40
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open": score -= 25
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True): score -= 20
    if token.get("owner_changed_recently", False): score -= 15
    return max(0, score)
```
#### 🧠 AI Context: Fine-tuned on exploit data and community feedback to evolve live scoring.

### ✳ Whale Pattern Watch
#### Detects concentration of large holders and flags possible manipulation.

```js
function scanWhales(holders) {
  const whales = holders.filter(h => h.balance >= 0.05)
  return whales.length > 5 ? 'Whale Cluster Found' : 'No Whale Pattern'
}
```
#### 🧠 AI Context: Flags centralization by clustering large wallets and tracking control zones.

### ✳ Risk Tag Translator
#### Converts risk score into clear human-readable labels.

```js
function getRiskTag(score) {
  if (score >= 80) return "Safe"
  if (score >= 50) return "Watch"
  return "Risk"
}
```
#### 🧠 AI Context: Converts raw numbers into labels using learned thresholds and behavior feedback loops.

### ✳ Insight Sync Logger
#### Saves token scoring results to internal DB and supports live model training.

```python
from datetime import datetime

def sync_insight(token_id, label, score):
    entry = {
        "token": token_id,
        "label": label,
        "score": score,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    if token_id not in insights_db:
        insights_db[token_id] = entry
    else:
        insights_db[token_id].update(entry)
```
#### 🧠 AI Context: Feeds into ZipWallet’s internal database and improves accuracy through feedback-driven training.
